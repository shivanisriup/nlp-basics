INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969,[13] also under the DAE.[14][15] In 1972, Government of India had setup a Space Commission and the Department of Space (DOS),[16] bringing ISRO under the DOS.

ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into polar orbits and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits. These rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and Earth observation satellites. Satellite navigation systems like GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed.
